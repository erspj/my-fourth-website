    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Uganda is a presidential republic, in which the President of Uganda is both head of state and head of government. The political system includes a multi-party structure, although the ruling party has been dominant for many years.
    </p>

    <h2>Executive Branch</h2>
    <p>
      The President serves as the chief executive and commander-in-chief of the armed forces. As of recent years, President Yoweri Museveni has held the position since 1986, making him one of Africa's longest-serving leaders.
    </p>

    <h2>Legislative Branch</h2>
    <p>
      The Parliament of Uganda is a unicameral body made up of elected representatives. It is responsible for making laws, approving the national budget, and overseeing the executive.
    </p>

    <h2>Judiciary</h2>
    <p>
      The judiciary is meant to operate independently from the executive. The highest court in Uganda is the Supreme Court, followed by the Court of Appeal and the High Court.
    </p>

    <h2>Political Climate</h2>
    <p>
      Uganda has experienced political tension, particularly during election periods. There have been concerns over human rights, media freedom, and the political opposition's ability to campaign freely.
